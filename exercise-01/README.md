# Exercise 1: Setting Up

Welcome to the class [Deep Learning](https://lehre.idh.uni-koeln.de/lehrveranstaltungen/wintersemester-2022-2023/deep-learning/)! This is the first exercise, and its goal is to prepare the exercise submission procedure.

## Step 1
Please register on GitHub. I will add your account to the GitHub organization [IDH-Cologne-Deep-Learning-Uebung](https://github.com/IDH-Cologne-Deep-Learning-Uebung), which is the umbrella for this and all future exercises. Starting in exercise 2, you will submit exercises as a branch on GitHub. Enter your Github username, your real name, your matriculation number and your email address in this [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yUb-tg69zmae4bIh4DDu9G6sP_zVHQ995e9RYmjH7Lk/edit?usp=sharing) so that I can assign the commits to the right person and add you to the organization.

## Step 2
The web page [https://learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org) offers a nice tutorial for branching with git. Please follow the first two levels of the "Introduction Sequence". Please note that the web app *only* contains the git part -- in reality, you'd still edit your files (outside of the git realm).

## Step 3
In order to get an impression of the prior knowledge of all course participants, I have deposited a short [questionnaire on Ilias](https://www.ilias.uni-koeln.de/ilias/goto_uk_crs_4799275.html). Please fill it out by next week Wednesday.
