# Exercise 1: Setting Up

Welcome to the class [Deep Learning](https://lehre.idh.uni-koeln.de/lehrveranstaltungen/wintersemester-2022-2023/deep-learning/)! This is the first exercise, and its goal is to prepare the exercise submission procedure.

## Step 1
Please register on GitHub. I will add your account to the GitHub organization [idh-cologne-deep-learning](https://github.com/idh-cologne-deep-learning), which is the umbrella for this and all future exercises. Starting in exercise 2, you will submit exercises as a branch on GitHub. Send me an [e-mail](mailto:nester@uni-koeln.de?subject=[Uebung%20Deep%20Learning]%20GH%20Username) that includes your GitHub username (and your regular name...).

## Step 2
The web page [https://learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org) offers a nice tutorial for branching with git. Please follow the first two levels of the "Introduction Sequence". Please note that the web app *only* contains the git part -- in reality, you'd still edit your files (outside of the git realm).
